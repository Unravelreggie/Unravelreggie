# 👋 Hi, I’m Reginald Zhang

🎯 **International Pharmacovigilance (PV) Management**  
🤖 **Automation & AI Systems Contributor @ Sinovac (科兴)**

I currently work in **international pharmacovigilance (PV)** at **Sinovac**.  
Within the PV department, I am responsible for **designing and implementing internal automation tools**, and I also **participate in group-level intelligent system initiatives**, including **AI-enabled platforms and vendor-integrated solutions**.

My work focuses on bridging **PV operations, data engineering, and applied analytics**, with hands-on involvement in **system implementation, automation pipelines, and cross-team collaboration**.

I am currently exploring the application of **AI models in pharmaceutical analytics**, with an emphasis on **active surveillance and risk signal detection**.
