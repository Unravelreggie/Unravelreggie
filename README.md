# 👋 Hi there, I’m Xiaoyuan “Reginald” Zhang

🎓 I recently completed my Master of Science in Public Health (MSPH) at the University of Miami, with a concentration in **Biostatistics** and a strong emphasis on **computational modeling** in psychology and neuroscience.

🧠 I’m passionate about **cognitive neuroscience**, **computational psychiatry**, and **decision-making research**, especially using tools like:
- Bayesian modeling (e.g., HDDM, HSSM)
- Neuroimaging (e.g., AFNI for fMRI analysis)
- Mixed-effects modeling and longitudinal analysis (SAS, R, Python)

💻 Tech Stack:
- **Languages**: Python, R, SAS, Shell (Unix)
- **Data tools**: pandas, tidyverse, AFNI, REDCap, Qualtrics
- **Modeling**: HDDM, HSSM, GLMM, machine learning
- **Visualization**: ggplot2, matplotlib, seaborn

🔬 Research Interests:
- Affective and cognitive flexibility in working memory
- How anxiety impacts decision-making under uncertainty
- Moral cognition and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s

🐶 Outside of research, I’m also a proud dog parent to a French Bulldog 🐾 and a Golden Retriever 🐕
